# The Road Ahead: Where We're Going with EVMPack

We're just getting started with EVMPack, and we've got a lot of exciting ideas for the future. This is our roadmap - a glimpse into what we're building next to make the Ethereum ecosystem even better.

## What We've Built So Far

Before we dive into the future, let's take a moment to appreciate how far we've come. We've already built a solid foundation for a more secure and collaborative Ethereum ecosystem. And all this in a week of development! 

*   **On-Chain Registry:** A decentralized registry for publishing and discovering smart contract packages.
*   **Robust Versioning:** A system for managing package versions based on the SemVer 2.0.0 standard.
*   **Secure, Versioned Proxies:** A set of transparent and upgradeable proxy contracts that are tightly integrated with our versioning system, making upgrades safer and more predictable.
*   **Powerful CLI:** An intuitive command-line interface that makes it easy to manage your packages and interact with the registry.
*   **IPFS Integration:** A seamless integration with IPFS for storing and retrieving package data.

This is the bedrock upon which we'll build the future of EVMPack.

## 1. A Guardian Angel for Your Code: Deterministic Static Analysis

Wouldn't it be great if you had a guardian angel watching over your code, catching potential security issues before they ever make it to production? That's what we're building with our deterministic static analysis system.

We're talking about a tool that will automatically scan your code for common vulnerabilities and best practice violations. It will be a mandatory step in the release process, so you can have peace of mind knowing that your code has been checked.

But it's only first step for security and hand audit.

## 2. Manager of documentation

Convenient management of all documentation, writing documentation using AI, checking documentation for compliance with changes before publishing a release


## 3. The App Store for Smart Contracts and them deploed implementations: A Curated Catalog

Finding high-quality, audited smart contracts shouldn't be a treasure hunt. We're building a curated catalog that will be like an app store for smart contracts.

You'll be able to browse, search, and filter packages, read reviews from the community, and find the perfect components for your next project. It's all about making it easier to stand on the shoulders of giants. You need ready and safety of implementation some Paymaster? Just select what you want and use it, when new version will come, you will be notify and you can upgrade safety, because you can see how many other contracts switch to new version and have a new implementation audit.

## 4. Bridging the Gap: The On-Chain Service Registry

It's time to bring the on-chain and off-chain worlds closer together. We're creating a decentralized marketplace for web2 services that you can access directly from your smart contracts.

Need to send an SMS, store a file on IPFS, or get some data from an API? You'll be able to find a provider in our on-chain service registry. It's all about making it easier to build powerful applications that connect to the real world.

## 5. From Zero to Hero in Minutes: Project Scaffolding

Getting started with a new project should be easy. That's why we're creating a project scaffolding system that will let you go from zero to hero in minutes.

We'll have templates for all kinds of projects, whether you're building a simple library, a reusable implementation, or a full-fledged dApp. Just run `evmpack init`, choose your template, and you're off to the races.

## 6. SemVer on Autopilot: Smart Versioning

Semantic versioning is a powerful tool, but it can be a pain to manage manually. We're going to put SemVer on autopilot.

We'll have tools to automatically validate and bump your version numbers, so you can focus on writing code instead of worrying about whether you've followed the rules. We'll also create a set of guides and best practices to help you navigate the wonderful world of versioning.



# P.S

This is just a taste of what's to come. We're always open to new ideas, so if you have a suggestion for how we can make EVMPack even better, we'd love to hear from you! Create a new issue with your idea!
