  "description": "EVMPack is an infrastructure project for the EVM that brings order and security to the lifecycle management of smart contracts. It combines a decentralized package registry with strong semantic versioning (SemVer 2.0.0), with a focus on securely updating implementations.\n\nKey benefits for security and reliability:\n- Transparent versioning: All available contract versions and their dependencies are recorded on-chain.\n- Controlled deployment: An integrated proxy factory ensures that new proxy contracts are created with predictable and verified implementations.\n- Decentralized governance: The right to publish new versions is strictly controlled by a list of maintainers. EVMPack is not just a dependency manager, but a framework for building fault-tolerant and easily maintainable decentralized systems.",
