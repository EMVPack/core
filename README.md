## ü§î Why EVMPack?

Building on Ethereum can be a challenge. We have great tools for development and testing, but the post-deployment world is a bit of a wild west. That's where EVMPack comes in. It's not a replacement for your favorite tools, but a complementary layer that brings order to the chaos.

Key benefits for security and reliability:
- **Transparent Versioning**: All available contract versions and their dependencies are recorded on-chain.
- **Controlled Deployment**: An integrated proxy factory ensures that new proxy contracts are created with predictable and verified implementations.
- **Decentralized Governance**: The right to publish new versions is strictly controlled by a list of maintainers.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Notice

This project is in active development. Currently, we only support the **OP Sepolia testnet**.
