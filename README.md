**EVMPack is an infrastructure project for the EVM that brings order and security to the lifecycle management of smart contracts. It combines a decentralized package registry with strong semantic versioning (SemVer 2.0.0), with a focus on securely updating implementations.**

## ü§î Why EVMPack?

Building on Ethereum can be a challenge. We have great tools for development and testing, but the post-deployment world is a bit of a wild west. That's where EVMPack comes in. It's not a replacement for your favorite tools, but a complementary layer that brings order to the chaos.

Key benefits for security and reliability:
- **Transparent Versioning**: All available contract versions and their dependencies are recorded on-chain.
- **Controlled Deployment**: An integrated proxy factory ensures that new proxy contracts are created with predictable and verified implementations.
- **Decentralized Governance**: The right to publish new versions is strictly controlled by a list of maintainers.
